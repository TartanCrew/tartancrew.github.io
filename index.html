Founded in 1987, we've been rowing on Pittsburgh's rivers for over 25 years! Right now we're hard at work training (in Pittsburgh and around the world) for the 2014 Fall Season.</p><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6"><h2>Interested in joining?</h2><p>It doesn't matter whether you're an undergraduate or graduate student, there's always space on our team for a new member. We structure our novice program to teach towards any athletic fitness, and any background. Yes, even if you've never gotten on a boat before.  We also have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PX8FsTFbYdJ3RWWB4qWfZwfLE9PRmb7xgVHMX4SQ4Uc/viewform">interest form</a>!</p><p><a href="#prospective" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Learn more</a></p><hr><h2>Rent-A-Rower</h2><p>Rent A Rower is a program that offers people living in the CMU/Shadyside/Squirrel Hill area the ability to "rent" our team members for various needs: cleaning, house work, yard work, moving, whatever!

Rowing is an excellent way to get into and stay in shape, while also experiencing the outdoors.  We row on all three of Pittsburgh's rivers, but spend most of our time on the Allegheny.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6"><h4>Collegiate Rowing at CMU</h4><p>In collegiate rowing programs (including our own), all rowers have a full year of novice rowing.  This is when you learn to row and begin to bond with your teammates.  After a year, you become a varsity oarsmen.   Novices typically row 4+ or 8+, while the varsity members also row singles and pairs.</p><p>However, not every member of the team pulls an oar.  We also have coxswains, who are the people in control of steering the boat and both motivating and leading the boat during races.  They are generally smaller than the oarsmen, and the excercise workouts are optional for them.</p></div><div class="col-lg-6"><img src="assets/imgs/womens_eight.jpg" alt="CMU Women's 8"><p>Women's Eight on the Allegheny.  </p><p>Credit: &copy;Will Ross</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6"><img src="assets/imgs/mens_four_camp_bob.jpg" alt="CMU Novice Men's 4"><p>CMU Novice Men's Four at Camp Bob, SC</p><p>Credit: Dan Tal</p></div><div class="col-lg-6"><h4>Schedules</h4><p>Our rowers come from every college at CMU, from the School of Computer Science to the College of Fine Arts.  This means that we as a crew have to work together and meet diverse scheduling needs.  Water practices are daily from Monday to Friday, with either a water practice or excercise session on Saturday.  Typically, the novice crewmembers row in the afternoons with the novice coach, while the varsity row in the morning.  The practices run from an hour to an hour and half, and you have to get to and from the boathouse, typically by running (it's a great workout!).  </p><p>The afternoon novice practice times will be decided by the crew to satisfy the most people's schedules as possible, but generally start around 5.  Similarly, varsity practices need to end in time for people to eat and be ready for 8:30 classes, so they begin at 5:15 AM.</p></div></div><div class="row hidden"><div class="col-lg-6"><h4>Competition</h4><p>While we are a smaller crew, we compete at several regattas in the fall and the spring.  Our planned list of regattas for the fall:</p></div><div class="col-lg-6"><img src="assets/imgs/crew_at_kerr_cup.jpg" alt="CMU Crew at the Kerr Cup Spring 2014"><p>CMU Crew at the Kerr Cup Spring 2014</p><p>Credit: Someone?</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><h4>Summary</h4><p>While there's a lot to know about rowing at CMU, the best thing to do is try it out!
